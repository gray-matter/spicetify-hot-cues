# hot-cues

Provides the hot cues feature for low-cost DJ'ing with Spotify.

## Usage

### Adding & removing hot cues

<kbd>N</kbd> to record hot cue N (eg. 1) when it doesn't exist, or skip to it when it does
<kbd>Shit</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> to remove hot cue N

## Limitations

When the user seeks to a certain position by hand, seeking with hot cues doesn't move the song cursor straightaway.
When the song gets played again, it is at the right position though.
